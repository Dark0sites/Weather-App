# Weather-App
This is a weather app made with React that is completely open-source.

To obtain the API key, you will need to go to https://openweathermap.org/. Then, you will need to sign in or create a new account. After that, navigate to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys, or click on the dropdown with your username and select "MY API KEYS". Copy your default key (you can create other keys if you want) and paste it in the const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY'; line in your App.jsx file.
